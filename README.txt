In order to run this application you must have composer intsalled. You will first need to run composer install from the command line.
Once that is complete you will need to check and see if it generated you an .env file.
If it didn't make one with the same stuff as the example env that laravel supplies.
Next, run "php artisan serve" the site will be hosted on the local host port specified in your .env
Then navigate to the localhost:port and everything should be working.
